This is the first project in the Odin Project! [The instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) tell the student to create a website highlighting their favorite recipes using HTML.
## What knowledge does this project demonstrate?
The goal of this project is to reinforce a core understanding of HTML.
